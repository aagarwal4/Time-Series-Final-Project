# Time-Series-Final-Project

This is the repository for the final project for Time Series, by Devin Bowers, Cara Qin, Fei Liu and Anant Agarwal. We developed a SARIMA model to forecast Canadian bankruptcy rates. The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/aagarwal4/Time-Series-Final-Project/blob/master/MSAN604_Time%20Series%20Final%20Project_Team1.4.pdf).

The code is documented [here](https://github.com/aagarwal4/Time-Series-Final-Project/blob/master/Team1.4.Rmd)
